## Description
<img src="/images/bird_spikes/spikes.jpg" alt="Photo of the bird spikes in situ" width="434"/>


I find that my rain gauge is quite popular with the local birds who like to sit on it as a look-out point. I wouldn't mind, but they do keep dropping things in there that aren't rain. So, with regret, I had to stop them.

## Notes For Printing
This is a pretty simple print and doesn't need any special settings. Obviously it needs to be a weatherproof material. The model can either be glued or taped to the gauge, as you see fit.
