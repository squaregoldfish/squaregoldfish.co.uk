## Version 1.02 – 2nd November 2014

* Added `clearFrameDelays()` method to simplify removal of custom frame delays.
Suggested by Ashley Brown.

## Version 1.01 – 7th June 2008

* Added the option for the animation to be drawn, but not started immediately.
  This way, you can wait until the whole page has loaded before the animation
  starts, which should hopefully make things a little less jerky.
  Thanks to Cameron Drysdale for the suggestion.

## Version 1.00 – 11th August 2007

* First release.
